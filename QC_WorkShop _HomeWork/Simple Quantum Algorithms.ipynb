    "Suppose we are given a 'black box function' $f$.  By this we mean that we are given some function $f$, which we can use, but we don't know its effect.  Specifically, $f$ acts on a bit of information, either $0$ or $1$, and returns an output, also either $0$ or $1$.  Thus, when we feed $f$ the inputs $0$ and $1$, the function will be describable by two out of the four following possibilities:\n",

A balanced function means that $f$'s outputs will be half $0$'s and half $1$'s, ex: $\\hspace{.15cm} f(0) \\rightarrow 1 \\hspace{.35cm} f(1) \\rightarrow 0 $.  A constant function means that the output will be either all $0$'s or all $1$'s, ex: $\\hspace{.15cm} f(0) \\rightarrow 1 \\hspace{.35cm} f(1) \\rightarrow 1 $.
